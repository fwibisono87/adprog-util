# adprog-util

this is a simple utility to create services and initialize git for the Advanced Programming course at the Faculty of CS, Univ. Indonesia.

You need to be in a UNIX-like environment to use this tool (LINUX, MACOS, WSL, or GIT BASH)

* You need the [spring-boot-cli](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/html/cli.html) to generate the services
* You also need git installed (duh)
* Modify the config file to your needs

MIT license, i do not take responsibility if this bricks your machine.
